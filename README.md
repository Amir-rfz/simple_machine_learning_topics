# simple_machine_learning_topics

This project combines key concepts from machine learning and statistics:

1. **Autoencoder**: Implementing an autoencoder to compress and reconstruct data, showcasing its use in dimensionality reduction.
2. **Regression & Least Squares**: Using regression models and least squares to fit lines and predict relationships between variables.
3. **Central Limit Theorem & Sampling**: Demonstrating the Central Limit Theorem through random sampling and analyzing the normal distribution of sample means.

The project includes Python implementations for each concept, with visualizations and practical examples.
